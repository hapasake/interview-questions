* Difference between list and array

* range function use

    The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end.
    example:
          a = "          pavan kumar yadav metla"
          print(a.strip())
          pavan kumar yadav metla

    Use the extend() method to add list2 at the end of list1:

      list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
      list2 = [1, 2, 3]

      list1.extend(list2)
      print(list1)
    ```

* tuples :

  Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.

  But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

  ```
    Example
    Convert the tuple into a list to be able to change it:

      x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
      y = list(x)
      y[1] = "kiwi"
      x = tuple(y)
      print(x)
  ```
