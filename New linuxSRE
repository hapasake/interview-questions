kill default command

To send a signal to a process, use the kill, pkill or pgrep commands we mentioned earlier on. But programs can only respond to signals if they are programmed to recognize those signals.
And most signals are for internal use by the system, or for programmers when they write code. The following are signals which are useful to a system user:
		SIGHUP 1 – sent to a process when its controlling terminal is closed.
		SIGINT 2 – sent to a process by its controlling terminal when a user interrupts the process by pressing [Ctrl+C].
		SIGQUIT 3 – sent to a process if the user sends a quit signal [Ctrl+D].
		SIGKILL 9 – this signal immediately terminates (kills) a process and the process will not perform any clean-up operations.
		SIGTERM 15 – this a program termination signal (kill will send this by default).
		SIGTSTP 20 – sent to a process by its controlling terminal to request it to stop (terminal stop); initiated by the user pressing [Ctrl+Z].

Why is it hard to build a consistent and reliable distributed system?
Define the CAP Theorem.
How would you assess how "deployable" a system is?
How would you deploy software to 5000 systems?
What are some examples of how you might scale a write/read-heavy app? Why?
How would you migrate application xyz from a traditional datacenter to AWS cloud?
Design a system that would scan 100,000 URLs for the Heartbleed vulnerability reasonably quickly. You can use any open source projects, programming languages, tools, etc.
How would you design a distributed lock?
You are hired by a startup and told "Here's a bunch of money.  We expect a million users on day one.  Go build a system that can handle it."  Now what?


Forget this role. Describe for me your “ideal” job.
		1. Working With People
Tell the interviewer that what really attracted you to this ideal job is that you get to work with people. Consider the interactions you've had with other departments and other staff at the company, and describe how those interactions with you as an outsider made you want to know more about the company and be a part of it. If you've received excellent customer service, don't forget to talk about its impact on you.
2. Delving Into the Workplace Culture
Many millennials seek out companies that fit their personality and style. Get to know the workplace culture there ahead of your interview. Stop by and see what the atmosphere is like, get to know some of your future co-workers through LinkedIn, and see what kind of reputation the company has on GlassDoor.com. When the office culture fits your personality, mention that as part of your ideal job.
3. Accept Challenges
Perhaps you are someone who likes to challenge yourself and grow. Maybe the position you applied for is a bit beyond your capabilities, but you have the confidence to make the job your own with your unique blend of hard work, personality and efficiency. Talk about how the company is growing, and you want to expand your horizons through a promotion after you prove yourself.
4. Support Others
You might enjoy a behind-the-scenes job that supports the company's main goals without necessarily being on the front lines of customer interactions. These jobs could be tech support, IT, sales support or computer programming. If you love numbers, talk about how your ideal job lets you look forward to working with a diverse group of people due to your talents that help others succeed.
5. Stay on the Leading Edge
You enjoy the opportunity to stay on the cutting edge of your industry, which is why your perfect job is with this company. Talk about how the employer's reputation as a leader in the field attracted you to the position.



Give us an example of when you handled a stressful situation.
Tell me about a time when you were part of a team faced with particularly difficult circumstances; what did you and the team do to resolve it?
Tell us about your short and long term goals?
Tell me about yourself. What do you do, day to day?
Tell me about the hardest you've ever worked.
What interests you about Apple?
How well do you work with people? Do you prefer working alone or in teams?
What motivates you to go the extra mile on a project or job?
SRE roles can often gravitate towards fire fighting and crises management’. Project work requires detailed, in-depth analysis with prolonged periods of focus. In an interrupt driven operational role, how do you balance support tasks against focused improvement work?
At your last review, what improvements did your manager suggest you make?
Tell me about the worst-run/best-run outage you've been a part of. What made it bad/well-run?


Scripting / Automation
You have a list of files in a directory in your homedir, all named “*.doc” (e.g. foo.doc, bar.doc, baz.doc), and you need to rename them to *.txt (e.g. foo.txt, bar.txt, baz.txt). There are thousands of them, so you need to use some form of scripting to do it. Show me how you’d do it.
Save a sorted list of the top 25 largest files/directories in /Applications to your desktop.  What command did you use?
In your chosen language write a script to list all of the files in a directory as a web page.
Create 250 files in /var/tmp with the content of the file being the same as the filename.  Schedule a cleanup job that will delete everything in /var/tmp at 10pm every night.  Show your work.
Write a monitoring script in your home directory that can detect if a host has been rebooting frequently.  Are there any assumptions the script makes?  Are there edge cases it won’t detect?
Data Structures / Algorithms
In programming, there are many elements and structures. Please describe the following and potential use cases: Variable, Conditional, Array, Loop, hash map.
Define Big O notation.
You have a list of random integers, how do you find two numbers whose sum is X?  What is the complexity of your solution? Can it be better?
Give a simple explanation of pass-by-value and pass-by-reference. What does your preferred programming language use? Some of them may even use something else differently.
What is recursion?  What is it good for?  Can you give me an example of a problem that would be solved by using recursion?
What happens when you index a column in a database?  Why does this make the lookups faster for that particular column?  What are the downsides to indexing?
Calculate the angle between the hour hand and minute hand on an analog 12-hour circular clock. Details
Given a list of variable size containing strings, write a function to filter out duplicates. Details
You have a fixed-size list of integers from 1 to N (inclusive), but one of them is randomly removed. How do you find that missing integer? Details
Write a function that accepts an integer and returns True if the number is a power of 2, False otherwise. Details
Configuration Management
Please tell us about your experience using configuration management to manage a file, package or process. What were some problems you encountered, how did you resolve them, and what did you learn from that experience?
QA / Tools
What different types of testing need to be carried out on a software system, and what tools would you use to achieve this testing? What testing is necessary to ensure a new service is ready for production?
How would you make key aspects of a software system traceable?
How do you handle version control?
Code Contribution
Have you contributed to any open source projects that you'd like to tell us about?



Coding Skills Assessment - Basic Phone Screen

Instructions for the interviewer
The goal of this assessment is to screen the candidate on their ability to write two programs. There are two phases to this phone assessment. The first phase tests algorithmically how a candidate can code a program to display the fibonacci sequence. The second phase of the assessment tests the candidates ability to parse an apache log file and display a list of the return codes in order sorted by the most frequent return codes first.  
There is a git repository with example solutions at ....
Part One
Display the output of a fibonacci sequence with a single integer input. 
Input specifies the number of places of which to calculate the sequence. 
Score
They understand the fibonacci sequence - 1 point
They ask clarifying questions before starting - 1 point
They get the output correct for the following inputs:
1 - 1 point
5 - 2 points
0 - 2 points

Part Two
Given a formatted apache log with http status codes (302,404,500,200,etc); display a series of K/V pairs including a count of each of the pairs.
Score
They ask clarifying questions before starting - 1 point
They get the correct output - 4 points
Part Two (a)
Take the same log from the previous example and display the K/V pairs in ascending order by frequency of return code. 
Score
They get the correct output - 3 points
Part Two (b)
Write unit / functional tests for the above code.
Score
Write a unit test - 3 points
Write a functional test - 3 points


Instructions to give the candidate
In this assessment, we will be evaluating your coding skills. There are two parts. The first tests your knowledge of a sequence and ability to write code to display this sequence. The second tests your ability to parse the output of an apache log file. You will use coderpad.io to write and run your code.
Part One
For the first part, we'd like you to write a program that displays the output of the fibonacci sequence given arbitrary positive integer input. 

Part Two
For the second part, we'd like you to write a program that takes a snippet of an apache log file as input and displays a summary of the http status codes and their frequency of occurrence. The output should be similar to:
302 2
404 1
200 6
Part Two (a)
To improve upon the previous answer, let's sort the output according to the frequency of return codes. The output should be similar to:
200 6
302 2
404 1
Part Two (b)
Now that you've successfully written an http log parser, can you write a test for the code.




Instructions for the interviewer
The goal of this assessment is to test the candidates' ability to write a python program that interacts with a web API. In this case, we will be coding against the XKCD JSON API. It's a public API, available at https://xkcd.com/json.html.
There is a git repository with example solutions at https://github.pie.apple.com/epic/xkcd-interview.
Part One
Get https://xkcd.com/info.0.json
Parse the json to see which number comic this is ('num' from the json)
Print the comic number and the title ('safe_title' from the json)
Score
They get the output correct - 3 point
They check the HTTP status code - 1 point
They ask clarifying questions before starting - 1 point
Part Two
Take the code from part one, but print out the last ten comics. They should write a function that allows them to get an arbitrary comic and either return a data structure with the details (could just be the json).
Score
They get the output correct - 4 point
They write a function that does most of the work - 5 point
They ask clarifying questions before starting - 1 point
Part Three (a)
Write tests for the functions that you've written above. It's possible they don't know how to write tests, in which case, follow the alternative part 3(b) below.
Score
Unit Test - 5 points
Integration Test - 5 points
Part Three (b)
Grab the last 100 comics and parse the alt text for each comic, then return the top 10 most used words, as an enhancement, return the list of words only used once, or the words leaving out any articles.
Score
Return the top 10 most used words - 5 points
Return the list of words only used once - 5 points


Instructions to give the candidate
In this assessment, we will be evaluating your coding skills. Using the laptop provided, please connect to this URL https://xkcd.com/json.html (write the url on the whiteboard) and read the documentation on that page.
Part One
For the first part, we'd like you to write a program that gets the metatdata for most recent comic, and produces output in the following format:
Output
￼
Hints
If they're using python, they should use the requests library, urllib3 is probably overkill
Part Two
Take the code from part one, but print out the last ten comics
Part Three (a)
Write tests for the function(s) that you've written in part two
Part Three (b)
Grab the last 100 comics and parse the alt text for each comic, then return the top 10 most used words, as an enhancement, return the list of words only used once, or the words leaving out any articles.

Personal
Are there any interesting technical side projects you've been involved in that you’d like to tell us about?
Have you contributed to any technical community discussions that you'd like to tell us about?



CAP Theorem — 

Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error
Availability: Every request receives a (non-error) response – without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write
Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes

http://robertgreiner.com/2014/08/cap-theorem-revisited/

5. How would you make software deployable…?
The ability to script the installation and reconfiguration of software systems is essential to controlled, automated change. Although (rightly) there is an increasing trend for new software to enable this, older systems and products suffer from the assumption that changes would be infrequent and minor, and so make automated changes difficult.
Software team members who appreciate the need to expose configuration and settings in a manner accessible to automation will talk about Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection, scripted installation, test harnesses, separation of concerns, command-line tools, and “infrastructure as code“.

Threading:
- A new thread is spawned within the existing process
- Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
- Memory is shared between all threads
- Mutexes often necessary to control access to shared data
- One GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) for all threads

Multiprocessing:
- A new process is started independent from the first process
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
- Memory is not shared between processes
- Mutexes not necessary (unless threading in the new process)
- One GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) for each process
