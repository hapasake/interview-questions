-----To overwrite the default hosts option in the playbook and limit execution to a certain group or host, include the option -l in your command:

ansible-playbook -l server1 myplaybook.yml

------The option --list-tasks is used to list all tasks that would be executed by a play without making any changes to the remote servers:

ansible-playbook myplaybook.yml --list-tasks
ansible-playbook myplaybook.yml --list-hosts
ansible-playbook myplaybook.yml --list-tags

------Controlling Playbook Execution
You can use the option --start-at-task to define a new entry point for your playbook. Ansible will then skip anything that comes before the specified task, executing the remaining of the play from that point on. This option requires a valid task name as argument:

ansible-playbook myplaybook.yml --start-at-task="Set Up Nginx"

-----To encrypt existing credential file
ansible-vault encrypt credentials.yml
